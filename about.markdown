Learning Computer Science or programming can be tricky.  There are a lot of great books out there, but many aren't digital, aren't designed for brand-new students, or cost a lot of money.

This text will likely change quite a lot, as I will be using it in courses I teach, and will undoubtedly need to adapt it to the needs of the current semester.  If you catch an error, please feel free to let me know.
