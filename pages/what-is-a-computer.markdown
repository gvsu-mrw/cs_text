I have read many definitions of what a computer is over the years. Most definitions describe
what a computer does (usually something about input, processing and output). All definitions I
have read are vague or abstract, and building a strong understanding of a vague concept is like
placing the foundation of a building on swampland. In this book, we define a computer computer more
simply: **A computer is a machine**.

Now, obviously we will eventually need a better definition than this. For now though, let us
begin to build a foundation with this simple idea that most people already understand. The idea
most people have of a machine is an object that does work for humans and has mechanical parts,
and indeed, early computers did have mechanical parts (and computers do work for humans). Over
time though, most of the mechanical pieces have been replaced by electrical ones. This in no way
makes a computer less of a machine. In the next section we will learn about how computers got started, 
and will see that the basic idea of a general purpose computer is built upon
a thought exercise of a very simple machine.
