We now know what an algorithm is.  But how do we write one?  Computers communicate in very different ways than humans do.  To interface with a computer, we will use a **programming language**.  Programming languages allow us to write algorithms in a way a computer can understand.

The programming language we will be using is Python.  It is designed to be very easy for people to read and write.  

{% raw %}
<script type="mpy-editor">
  import sys
  print(sys.version)
  a = 42
  print(a)
</script>
{% endraw %}
